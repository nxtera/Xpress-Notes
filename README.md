## What was my motivation?
To gain further experience programming in the back end by creating an app that uses  Express.js that will save, retrieve and delete data from a JSON file. 
 

## What did I do?
Revise the knowledge gained from the previous week in coding bootcamp on Express.js to build an app. I used the starter code as a basis, further developed the back end to reach full functionality, connect it to the front end and finally deploy the entire application to Heroku.


## What did I learn?
- How we can use Express.js to store and retrieve data with a JSON file.
- How to link front end development with the back end.
- How to deploy applications on Heroku.
